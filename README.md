CS7641 - Supervised Learning Assignment

File Locations:
All files for this project can be found on my github at:
https://github.com/brockrx/CS7641---Supervised-Learning-Assignment

Datasets:
Cancer inhibitor classification dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/xiaotawkaggle/inhibitors

Biological response classification dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bioresponse/overview

Contents:

Data files: 
Located in the data folder under the respective project folder. 
There are several data files for the cancer inhibitor project and only 1 data file for the biological repsonse project

Jupyter Notebooks:
There is 1 ipython file for each project. 

Note on file structure:
I highly recommend maintain the file strucuture as this repository as relative paths are used for saving and loading json files.
These json files contain the performance results of the models that are developed within the scripts.
As the notebooks are written, there is no distinction between file names, and all paths are written relative to the source file location.
This means that running both notebooks from the same folder will overwrite results of the first analysis.

Required libaraies:
Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Json
